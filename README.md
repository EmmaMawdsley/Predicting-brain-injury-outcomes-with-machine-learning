# Predicting-brain-injury-outcomes-with-machine-learning
R code for predicting psychosocial outcomes after brain injury neurorehabilitation - comparing logistic regression regularised with elastic net, random forest, linear support vector machine and unregularised logistic regression for 5 psychosocial outcomes after discharge, and length of admission with linear regression (with and without elastic net regularisation).
Detailed example of an ML study taken through data preprocessing, model development and then internal validation with nested repeated cross validation.
I need to make an ethics ammendment but if possible I will publish the anonymised data in the future to allow researchers to practice using ML and consider adapting the code for your own projects
