# Predicting-brain-injury-outcomes-with-machine-learning
R code for predicting psychosocial outcomes after brain injury neurorehabilitation - comparing logistic regression with elastic net, random forest, linear support vector machine and unregularised logistic regression for 4 psychosocial outcomes at the time of discharge.
Example of an ML study taken through data preprocessing, model development and then internal validation
I need to make an ethics ammendment but if possible I will publish the anonymised data in the future to allow researchers to practice using ML and consider adapting the code for your own projects
